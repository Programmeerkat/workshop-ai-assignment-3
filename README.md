# Assignment 3 – AI-Powered App Migration Challenge

---

## 🚀 The Mission

You're part of a front-end innovation team tasked with **modernizing an existing open-source application**. Your mission is to **rebuild the front end** of an app using a **modern JavaScript framework** of your choice (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, etc.).

> 🎯 **Your goal:** Create a functional prototype that captures the *look and feel* of the original app, but runs on a clean, modern tech stack. You're not expected to migrate the full backend—just the front-end experience.

## 🧠 But There's a Twist...

Your team is working under a **tight deadline** and limited resources—so you're expected to **use generative AI to boost your development speed**.

Use tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor to:
- Generate boilerplate code
- Translate UI logic into your chosen framework
- Create components quickly
- Troubleshoot bugs

> ⏱️ You have just **2 hours** to complete and present your migration prototype.

## 🧩 Project Inspiration

Choose an open-source app to clone and reimagine:

- 🐘 [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org) – A decentralized social media alternative to X/Twitter. [GitHub](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon)
- 💬 [**Mattermost**](https://mattermost.com) – An open-source messaging platform. [GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost)

Or bring your own open-source app—just make sure it's publicly accessible.

## 🛠️ Recommended Tools & Stack

- **Framework**: React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, Next.js, Nuxt – your choice!
- **AI Dev Tool**: [Cursor](https://cursor.com) – AI-enhanced coding experience
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) – Fast and easy deployment
- **Optional**: TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, shadcn/ui, Radix for UI acceleration

---

## 🧾 Deliverables

At the end of 2 hours, each team should:
1. Share a **deployed link** to your app
2. Present a **brief demo** (5 min max)
3. Reflect on **how AI helped you** (or didn’t)

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Break down the app into UI sections: sidebar, feed, chat, etc.
- Use AI to scaffold components quickly
- Don't get stuck on full data integration—mock it!
- Focus on visual and functional fidelity
